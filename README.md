# Tic-Tac-Toe
This C++ program implements a customizable Tic Tac Toe game. Players choose the board size and take turns entering moves by specifying row and column numbers. The code ensures valid inputs, updates the board, and checks for a winner or a draw. Modular functions make the game logic easy to follow and extend.
